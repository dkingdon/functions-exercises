## Homework thoughts

I spent a lot of time on these exercises, in part because I was really trying to solve them without any outside aid.

Assignment 3 (nth power) gave me some trouble, perhaps because I was over thinking it. I decided to move on and come back to it, which proved to be the right call.

My solution for assignment 7 (Vowel Count) is quite lengthy, it is the only thing I could make work. Suppose I should check the solutions tab to compare.

Assignment 9 and 10 had me completely baffled. I had to peek at the solutions. Would have never thought to put a loop inside a loop.  

I was a able to complete all of the mathematical functions, but the string related functions were difficult for me. I spoke with the evening TA and she helped me solve the ASCII triangle function. I'm still feeling iffy on writing my own loops.
